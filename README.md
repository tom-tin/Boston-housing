# Purpose: To understanding the Boston House Price dataset

## Techniques use: Visualization + Linear Regression + Decision Tree + Random Forest + Comparison between these methods

### Outline:

    Step 1: Getting and setting up the data.
    Step 2: Load the data.
    Step 3: Visualize the data (cleaning not needed, only some pre-processing).
    Step 4: Do a LS- Simple Linear Regression (Using Numpy), calculate the error.
    Step 5: Using scikit learn to implement a multivariate regression (use .fit() to train and .predict() to predict new labels.
    Step 6: Using Training and Validation, Predicting Prices
    Step 7: Residual Plots (To check for normality of residuals)
    
    Step 8: Use Decision Tree (lone tree) and Random Forest to predict and compare that to LR
